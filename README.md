# Title: Get Started Contributing to Open Source Through Civic Tech
### Description: 
Contributing to open source civic technology is a great way to give back to a project you care about, become a better community participant, and help make a project more useful while also leveling up your own personal skills. But often those who want to contribute have a few misconceptions that prevent them from making that first pull request, including:
- I’m not a good enough programmer to contribute to open source
- I don’t know the project well enough to contribute
- I don’t write code, so I can't add value to the project

After this talk, you'll walk away with an understanding of open source and civic tech. You'll feel empowered to contribute to a project that interests you and have a guide of what to look for when searching for that project. You'll also have a set of actionable best practices to follow when making your first open source pull request so that you feel less intimidated when contributing to a project.
